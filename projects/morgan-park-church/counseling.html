            <h3>The Center for Spiritual Health at Morgan Park Baptist Church</h3>
            <p>The Center for Spiritual Health is a Community Outreach of Morgan Park Baptist Church. The Center has been established to bring opportunities for spiritual growth, health and healing to the people of Beverly/Morgan Park. The members of Morgan Park Baptist Church recognize that there are four dimensions to true wholeness: spiritual health, psychological health, physical health and social health. All four dimensions must be addressed if one is to be truly healthy. We believe health, healing and wholeness are vital dimensions of our church’s vision and mission. We affirm a benevolent, loving, compassionate God while embracing a healing and healthy Christianity.</p>
            <p>The Center for Spiritual Health offers a variety of services and programs designed to help bring healing, wholeness, and holiness to the people of our church and our community.  PLEASE SEE CHURCH CALENDAR.</p>
