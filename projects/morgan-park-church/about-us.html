                <h2>WHO WE ARE...</h2>
                <p>Morgan Park Baptist Church is a place where everyone can find a faith community.  We are a member of the American Baptist Churches/Metro Chicago and the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.</p>
                <p>We, American Baptists, worship the triune God of the Bible, who is eternally one God in three persons.  This one, true God is most clearly revealed to us in the incarnate Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
                <p>We, American Baptists, hold that all who truly seek God are both competent and called to develop in that relationship.  We have rejected creeds or other statements that might compromise each believer's obligation to interpret Scripture under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and within the community of faith.  We, American Baptists, also celebrate the special gift of all believers, testifying that God desires to use each of us in ministry and service.</p>
                <p>We, American Baptists, have cherished freedom and pursued it for millions around the world. Manifestations of this "soul freedom" include supporting separation of church and state, advocating for people everywhere to be guaranteed the right to worship free from discrimination, and lifting up respectful dialogue among all peoples.</p>
                <p>We, American Baptists, are gifted by a variety of backgrounds and find unity in diversity.  We embrace a pluralism of race, ethnicity, and gender.  We have a respectful remembrance for the past and a vital vision for the future.</p>
                <p>All are welcome to come and worship with us at Morgan Park Baptist Church.  Sunday worship is every Sunday at 11:00 am. We believe everyone who is seeking a fuller faith will be enriched by sharing in our fellowship.</p>
